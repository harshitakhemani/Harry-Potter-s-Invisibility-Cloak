# Harry-Potter-s-Invisibility-Cloak
This project comprises of an application based on the image processing technique called color detection and segmentation. Just the way Harry Potter's cloak enables him to become invisible, similarly this application, with the help of computer vision cloaks the desired area (of a particular color) of user's video making it seem invisible!
